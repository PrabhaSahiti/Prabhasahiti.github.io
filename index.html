				<p>I am a final year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Kancheepuram, where I am advised by Professor <a href="http://www.iiitdm.ac.in/old/sudhir.html">Sudhir Varadarajan </a>.
    		I'm passionate about Medical Device Design for Point-of-Care Diagnosis and Medical Imaging. I enjoy Signal and Image Processing, Machine Learning, Product Design and Entrepreneurship. I am currently working on Physiological Modelling of Athlete Behaviour with my Institute's Technology - Business Incubator, <a href="http://www.madeit.iiitdm.ac.in/">MaDeIT. </a> </p>
			<p>Previously, I was an Artificial Intelligence Intern with <a href = "https://www.urufit.com/">Scermlind </a>Healthcare Innovations where I was working on sleep, stress and recovery of athletes. I also worked with <a href = "http://www.startoonlabs.com/">Startoon Labs</a> where I worked on EMG Signal Processing and Analysis and the Range of Motion detection for their wearable physiotherapy toolkit, Pheezee.</p>
			
			When I am not busy coding or hatching plans for what my next startup would look like you can find me writing <a href = "https://openendsblog.wordpress.com">here</a>, reading, doodling and dreaming about my pet cat. </div><!-- /.blurb -->
