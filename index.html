			<p>I am a final year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Kancheepuram, where I am advised by Professor <a href="http://www.iiitdm.ac.in/old/sudhir.html">Sudhir Varadarajan </a> and Professor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karthic-narayanan-rengarajan-81091a26/">Karthic Narayanan</a>.
    		I work on problems in Biomedical Device Design for Prosthesis, Imaging and Point-of-Care Diagnosis. I enjoy Signal and Image Processing, Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Product Design. I am currently working on Physiological Modelling of Athlete Behaviour with my Institute's Technology - Business Incubator, <a href="http://www.madeit.iiitdm.ac.in/">MaDeIT. </a> </p>
			
			<p>When I am not busy coding or hatching plans for what my next startup would look like you can find me writing <a href="https://openendsblog.wordpress.com/">here</a>, reading, doodling and dreaming about my pet cat.</p>

			<h2> Research </h2>
			<p><strong> Physiological Modelling of Athlete Behaviour to Improve Performance</strong> (Ongoing)
			 <br>MaDeIT Innovation Foundation
			 <br>The aim of the project is to understand curated data of various athletes trained under a controlled environment. This study mainly focuses on providing insights using the above data. The variables used for this study to understand this behaviour are Heart Rate (HR) in BPM, Volume of Oxygen / carbon dioxide (V’O2 / V’CO2) in L / min and energy expenditure (EE) which provide insights about training and recovery to the athletes to improve their performance.

Ankle Society.
			<br>
			<br> The aim of the project was to improve the accuracy of the IMU algorithms to detect the Range of Motion of a particular joint. The algorithms were developed to improve the range of motion detection for the foot and ankle joint and the accuracy  was compared with the current gold standard, the Digital Goniometer.
